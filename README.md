# Taher-s-Macropad-project---Hackpad
My first time attempting something of the kind . I had to learn how to do things like create a PCB , understand how to use applications like autodesk and kicad , but it was fun and didnt take too long

I personally Havent exactly mastered using autodesk for my cad since this was my first time creating something on the app , so i couldnt figure out how to import the parts successfully as the computer just couldnt find them . 

I started this project initially when i saw a tiktok about the project and how hackclub were trying to create a engineering community or sorts and joined to try and learn something new
